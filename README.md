> Tried to make a free to use service for everyone but failed. It was a great experience to serve millions of people but it was not possible to continue it for free. Project gets more expensive as it grows. It was hard to find a sponsor for this project, everyone wanted to use it for free but no one wanted to pay for its expenses. It was afforable for me for a while but when the database and requests increased, everything became more expensive. It was a great experience to serve a free to use service, thanks.
